# ü§ñ AI-Powered Product Owner Automation

### Automating Backlog Creation from Scanned Sprint Notes using n8n + GPT-5 + Jira Cloud

---

## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end automation pipeline that transforms **handwritten Product Owner notes** or **sprint planning documents** into structured **Jira Epics and Stories**.

### üß© Key Components
- **n8n Workflow Orchestration**
- **GPT-5 Vision (OCR + LLM context extraction)**
- **Jira Cloud API**
- **Google Drive Integration** for note upload
- **Slack (optional)** for story review loop

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. A Product Owner uploads scanned notes to Google Drive.  
2. n8n triggers a workflow to:
   - Extract text using GPT-5 Vision
   - Normalize the note
   - Convert to Epic + Stories JSON
   - Create Jira issues via API  
3. Stories appear automatically under the correct Epic in Jira.
